I have found that my mind processes five basic structures: <strong>systems, societies, methods, patterns,</strong> and <strong>classifications</strong>. Everything I do or think is based off of one of these structures. Systems are interactions bounded by logic; societies are interactions not bounded by logic. Methods include strategies, functions, and algorithms; patterns include formulas and rules. Classifications, especially hierarchies, are my basic structure of memory.


For a long time I couldn't decide what creativity really meant. I think I have it figured out now. Creativity is non-deterministic, it has no reason. When I perform a solo while gigging, I'm only happy with it afterward if I find myself asking, "What happened there? Why did I do that?" -- meaning, Where did that come from? I believe this to be the basis of creativity.
