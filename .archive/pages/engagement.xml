                    Jamie and Timski spent most of the summer of 2012 together, but the crucial tests of their relationship came in the form of two
                    getaway trips: first, a camping trip in NH with a large portion of Timski's family, and then a road trip to Milwaukee to visit with Jamie's
                    closest friends. After returning from the road trip and allowing a couple of days to pass, Timski started itching to propose. He spilled
                    the beans to his sister-in-law Jenn at lunch the following Monday, and the idea snowballed from there. By Tuesday evening, he had
                    his plan put together.

                            On Thursday that week, Jamie was to be at a meeting in the evening, and Timski was supposed to be at a softball game.
                            Timski sneakily decided this would be the perfect time to go buy the ring. Accompanied by his mother Maureen and Jenn, he headed to the Square One Mall in
                            Saugus, MA, which houses several jewelry stores.

                            The first stop was Hannoush Jewelers, and it turned out to be the only stop that was necessary. The salesman, Frank, showed off a bunch of rings,
                            but the only one Timski was interested in was this petite ring with an unusual blue diamond. Frank, Maureen, and Jenn tried explaining to Timski
                            that an engagement ring is supposed to have a <i>real diamond</i> (you know, the colorless kind), wedding bands are important (and the one Timski
                            wanted wouldn't fit well with a wedding band), and other such things in order to help him find the right ring, but the little
                            ring with the blue diamond seemed to be absolutely but inexplicably perfect.
                            They searched other shops that night, but eventually came back to Hannoush, where Timski decided to take a risk and get the unusual ring.

                            On the night of Friday, August 31 2012, Timski had a gig with his band <l href="/pages/bands.html#The Runaround Sound">The Runaround Sound</l> at
                            the <a prefix=" " href="http://www.capeannbrewing.com/">Cape Ann Brew Pub</a>. Since that was where he and Jamie had their first date, he thought it would be the
                            perfect time and place to propose.

                            Jamie arrived from work a little bit into the first set. Surprisingly, she didn't find it odd that most of Timski's immediate family was present, given that
                            they don't usually all come to his gigs. At the first set break, Timski greeted Jamie and asked if she wanted to go get some air outside.
                            They walked out onto the dock overlooking Gloucester's inner harbor; it was a gorgeous evening. There he pulled the ring out of his pocket and asked Jamie if she would marry him.
                            Cheers and camera flashes abounded from the pub as Jamie accepted.

                    The happy couple celebrated their engagement with a party at their residence on October 6, 2012. Unfortunately, everyone
                    was too busy having fun to take pictures!
