I have one cat; his name is Fidel Castro. 
I adopted him and his brother, Charles Darwin, in January 2010 with my roommate at the time.
I took full reponsibility of both cats in September 2010.
In January 2011, Darwin got sick and I had to put him down.
Fidel and Darwin were born around Thanksgiving 2009.
