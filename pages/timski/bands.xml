                            The Runaround Sound formed in the winter of 2007/2008 out of the remnants of a
                            high school band, <a prefix=" " href="/gallery/heap/cl0.jpg">"The Checklist"</a>, 
                            a.k.a. <a prefix=" " href="/gallery/heap/sp0.jpg">"The Square Pegs"</a>.
                            We play covers of
                            various ska/reggae/rocksteady tunes, some standards and some rare gold. We play bars,
                            events, weddings, you name it. Our job is to get you to dance. The band is on
                            Facebook--search for a profile named "Run Around".

                            The <a prefix=" " suffix=" " href="/gallery/heap/bfb0.jpg">BFB</a> is a professional 
                            marching band representing the Boston Firemen. We play at several parades
                            in the Boston area throughout the year. Our repertoire is made up of very loud and proud
                            marches, such as Bravura, Washington Post March, National Emblem, Hostrauser's March,
                            etc. I play the trombone and the sousaphone with the BFB (not simultaneously). My first gig
                            with the BFB was in Quincy on June 16, 2007.

                            The <a prefix=" " href="http://facebook.com/capeannbigband">CABB</a>, started in the fall of 2010
                            by a group of very dedicated musicians primarily
                            from Gloucester, is Cape Ann's premiere big band. The band is directed by Carlos Menezes,
                            and is managed by a board consisting of Carlos, Paula, Shawn, Mike, and Rick.
                            Originally a founding member, I had to depart from the group in late fall 2010. I joined
                            up again in summer 2011 on 4th trombone.
