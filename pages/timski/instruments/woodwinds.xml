        <p>
            I have some woodwinds in the collection too. I don't really play any of these well, but
            I can play notes and simple songs.

                            Jamie and I bought this horn from Ted. Isn't she sexy?

                            She needs some work (corks, pads, etc), but overall she's a playable horn.
