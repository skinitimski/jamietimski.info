            I have a thing for data. I like good data and I like manipulating good data.
            After all, it's my job. Lists are a form of data, and I have prepared some
            good examples of lists and transformed them here. I can always use more data,
            but compiling good data takes time, and I'm lazy about such unimportant things.
