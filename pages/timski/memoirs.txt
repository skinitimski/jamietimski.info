            I really hate it when I forget things that happened in my life. I've always hung on to old notebooks, files, and other
            artifacts of my life so that I can go back someday and reflect. I've done a fair amount of reflecting already--one of my favorite things
            to do is pull out old notebooks and read what I was thinking about at the time.

            Some people keep a journal. I think keeping a journal is a wonderful way of keeping records for reflection, but I've never
            been able to habitually keep a consistent journal. Whenever I feel like something is important or relevant, I write it down
            somewhere. Sometimes things are important enough that I compile a memoir.

            So here is an incomplete collection of notes and writings that I feel like opening to the public.
