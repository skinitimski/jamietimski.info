            <a suffix=" " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park">South Park</a> is by far my favorite show on television. It is brilliantly hilarious and ruthlessly absurd.
            I know a great deal about the show, about as much as or more than anyone else. Recently I decided it was time to put my knowledge and appreciation of the show to good use.

            Please note that reviewing every episode of South Park is a mammoth task. I have 15+ seasons of episodes to review, and it will take a while.
            Below are the seasons for which I have reviewed episodes so far.
