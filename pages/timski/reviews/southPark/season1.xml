            I am not as familiar as I would like to be with Season 1. When the show first came on TV, I was young and
            not really allowed to watch it. As a result, I went years before watching some of the episodes in Season 1.

            Season 1 is quite different from the other seasons, which is to be expected of a long-running show in its infancy.
            I like how different a character Cartman is at this point in the series--he's still very na&#xEF;ve and lacks the
            manipulative capacities to be as malicious as he is later in the series.

            It's amazing how early on some of the most famous and recognizable South Park elements were introduced, such as Kenny dying,
            "screw you guys--I'm going home", Mr. Hankey, and the vicious parodies of celebrities. After catching up on Season 1 for the
            first time a few years ago, I was left wondering, so what happened in the rest of the series?
