            This season contains some of my favorite "classic" episodes. It opens up with an episode of the "other side of the story" genre (Rainforest Schmainforest), and then immediately delves into
            some of my favorite episodes of all time, including the Meteor Trilogy, Chinpokomon, The Red Badge of Gayness, and others.
