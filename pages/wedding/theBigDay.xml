                    <b>Trains:</b> The MBTA Commuter Rail stops in <a prefix=" " href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/stations/?stopId=71">downtown Gloucester</a>.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Automobiles:</b> Take MA Route 128 into Gloucester. At Grant Circle (the first rotary after the bridge), go 3/4 of the way
                    around and take the exit for 127 toward Annisquam (Washington Street, northbound). About

                <h3>Parking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limited "priority" parking will be available on Ferry Street nearby the Jenkins' residences </li>

                <h3>Attire</h3>
                <p>
                    Expected attire should be "dressy casual". That means wear clothes that are comfortable for an all-day cookout,
                    but will look nice in pictures. The reception and ceremony will both take place on the grass, so shoes with heels
                    are not recommended. The lovely couple probably won't be wearing footwear, so you won't have to either!
