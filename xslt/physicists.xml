        <title>Phamous Physicists</title>
        <prose>
            I was in the lab with Drew one day and we were looking at Google images of physicists. What we noticed was that almost every physicist we saw had a picture of himself or herself in front of a blackboard.

                    After the ingenious suggestion by Einstein that light comes in discrete packets (photons) 
                    that behave like particles, which was in great contrast to the canonical view that light 
                    is a wave phenomenon, de Broglie daringly proposed the opposite in his 1924 Ph.D. thesis: 
                    entities commonly understood to be particles (like electrons) exhibit wavelike properties 
                    as well.
